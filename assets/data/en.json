Does this correlation hold for languages with a richer liquid inventory? </i> <br><br> Analyzing the articulations of seven speakers, I was able to assemble a pilot analysis. <a class='simplelink' href='./../assets/misc/an_investigation_of_tamil_liquids.pdf' target='_blank'>View full paper > (somewhat outdated)</a>",
