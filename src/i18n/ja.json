In forms such as this one, pitch-accent becomes relavant, as the downstep mora of Japanese pitch contours don't tend to devoice even when they match the environments. It is in these cases, that Optimality Theory, which uses conditions rather than rules to find the best fit, is apt. The paper outlines the increasingly complex factors that may affect whether vowels appear devoiced, and how they fit into Optimality Theory conditions.",
